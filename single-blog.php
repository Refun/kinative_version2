                     <p class="blog-para max-738 ">The user research importance is quite high. Understanding the behaviour, preferences, feelings of the users has always been the dream of user experience researchers. Are users enjoying experience with the brand? Are they frustrated and overwhelmed by heavy text and million of messages and pop-ups? Are they willing to buy something or they visit your web or app for inspiration? Are they feeling engaged and they love your brand? Or maybe they like the product, but they switch to your competitors because of the poor digital experience that you provide? Understanding your users can help you optimize specific aspects of the experience and create a “wow” effect ! Wow effect normally leads to loyalty, sales, engagement, WOM, thousands of shares and recognition.

                    <p class="blog-para max-738">Nowadays providing an outstanding product is not enough, you need to drive emotions, make people love, admire your brand, put them in the center of your strategy and make them see themselves in your messages, make people laugh, cry, but they shouldn’t stay sceptical about you.

                      <h3 class="blog-points">MAKE IT SIMPLE</h3>
                    <p class="blog-para max-738">Now with millions of messages, adds and competitors you can’t afford yourself just being OK or ignore your target’s feelings! If a website or app is difficult to use, people leave and where they go? Yes, to your competitors! Will they come back and give you a second chance? To be honest, don’t think so! If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave. If users get lost on a website, they leave. If a website’s information is hard to read or doesn’t answer users’ key questions, they leave. It influences conversion rate as if a client can’t find product or service he is interested in easily and fast, he won’t click the button “ buy” or “ contact”. User experience also influences employees productivity, they waste time being lost on your intranet, it is your money you waste by paying them to be at work without getting work done. World is going towards simplicity, the simpler your product is, the better!.
