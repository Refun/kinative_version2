                     <p class="blog-para max-738 ">Front End-Designer , Front-End-Developer or Front-End-Engineer! Which one is for me? Sounds kind of weird? May be it should be! In the last few years these terms are being used in the tech industry simultaneously. But you might wonder no matter how much they are similar in words there are differences among themselves.
For all of these terms defined above you must need a proper knowledge of HTML(used for suitable page markup),CSS(used for robust styling) and JAVASCRIPT(used for adding tons of interactive purposes mainly).Let us go through three of these sectors deeply.
Front-End-Design:
Frank to say I am very much delighted to hear the emerging term ‘Front-end-Design’ .So, what is front end design exactly. Frontend design involves creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface.” Front end designer has the duty of maintaining a pixel perfect experience in the user interfaces . An user interface designer will hand over the design to him and you do look after it.
1. They understand UX principles and best practices, but may not spend their time conducting research, creating flows, and planning scenarios.
2.They have a keen eye for aesthetics, but may not spend their time pouring over font pairings, comparing color palettes, or creating illustrations and icons.
3.They can write JavaScript, but may not spend their time writing application-level code, wiring up middleware, or debugging.
4.They understand the importance of backend development, but may not spend their time writing backend logic, spinning up servers, load testing, etc.
Font-End-Development:
“Front-End-Developer” is the most cherished one and also one of the most widely known term in the web world for a long time. I have lived on this term for all of career. A website has a physical 2 ends which are front-end and back-end. So you can understand easily all the jobs in the front end part that are maintained efficiently by a front end developer .Writing HTML codes through maintaing proper semantics rule, styling code with proper selection of html tags and also arranging them by order and writing user interactive codes and contributes to writing robust javascript codes. In one word he will perform proper translation of the UI/UX design wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the application. Actually it is the combination of both the term ‘Front-End-Engineer’ and ‘Front-End-Designer’.
Here comes the most anticipated term ‘Front-End-Engineer’. What the heck the term ‘engineer’ doing in the front end development industry. Let’s make it clear. Actually this is not very long time ago, when the front-end engineering term has coined for the first time in web development industry. Often I read conversation about the difference between these two. In a word it’s the engineering approach in the development world of Front-End part. With the emergence of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular the Front end part has become so much extensive and rich. It’s almost difficult for one person to handle all the activities with a single hand.
A modern engineering approach of web development differs from typical development process in many ways. Firstly, with the development environment and then page loading and performance issues. By the blessings of NODE.js and it’s package manager NPM, a modern front-end engineer now has to deal with CLI (Command line interface) for using build task commands. Now there are also css technologies like Sass and Less and also Html templating engine like Jade, Embed Js,Handlebar.js etc which needs a lot of technical implementation of your knowledge.Here are some requirements for a Front-End-Engineer to fulfill.
01. Efficiency in writing semantic coding approach.
02. Master moduler CSS or use a CSS pre processors like LESS, SCSS, Stylus and so on. 
03. Know your main front-end engine “Browsers”. Learn how browser’s load and render assets including browser engine structure. 
04. Have a proper understanind of RAW Javascript before learning jQuery — a lot of newbies directly jump into jQuery without learning the main programming concepts and Javascript. It is ok for a front end designer or may be for some Front-End-Developer(not all) but certainly not for a Front-End-Desinger. 
06. Gain knowledge of client- server architecture and network performance evaluation to see the assets loading to your page using chrome or firefox developer tools or your favorite developer tools
08. Master CLI or terminal.Believe me, when you are going to work with build or automation process for your project you gonna need some command line skills and understandings.
09. Master any of the one automation/build tools like Grunt ,Gulp or Webpack — about how to build your package to minify/uglify your CSS and JS files, cleaning extra markups and style classes in production version of your page.
11. Lean how to use GIT version controlling using Github. Even if you are working alone in a project using Github is a top notch professional approach and your employer would definitely give an extra consideration if you have intermediate-advanced Git skills.
12. Try to deploy your project on cloud platform like Heroku and learn how to directly deploy projects by connecting Github and Cloud platform using CLI.
Happy learning and implementing is the way to go. Learn one by one and never fear to try. Because If you don’t go through the period of trying and failing simultaneously, you may never be creative.

                    <p class="blog-para max-738">Now with millions of messages, adds and competitors you can’t afford yourself just being OK or ignore your target’s feelings! If a website or app is difficult to use, people leave and where they go? Yes, to your competitors! Will they come back and give you a second chance? To be honest, don’t think so! If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave. If users get lost on a website, they leave. If a website’s information is hard to read or doesn’t answer users’ key questions, they leave. It influences conversion rate as if a client can’t find product or service he is interested in easily and fast, he won’t click the button “ buy” or “ contact”. User experience also influences employees productivity, they waste time being lost on your intranet, it is your money you waste by paying them to be at work without getting work done. World is going towards simplicity, the simpler your product is, the better!.
